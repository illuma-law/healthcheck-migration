A focused migration backlog health check for Spatie's [Laravel Health](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-health/v1/introduction) package.

This package provides a simple, direct health check to verify that your application's database migrations are up to date.

## Features

- **Pending Migration Check:** Automatically detects if there are any pending database migrations that haven't been run yet.
- **Migration Count:** Reports the exact number of pending migrations in the health summary and meta data.
- **Detailed Meta:** Lists a sample of pending migration filenames for easier debugging via JSON endpoints.

## Installation

Require this package with composer:

```shell
composer require illuma-law/healthcheck-migration
```

## Usage & Integration

Register the check inside your application's health service provider (e.g. `AppServiceProvider` or a dedicated `HealthServiceProvider`), alongside your other Spatie Laravel Health checks:

### Basic Registration

```php
use IllumaLaw\HealthCheckMigration\MigrationBacklogCheck;
use Spatie\Health\Facades\Health;

Health::checks([
    MigrationBacklogCheck::new(),
]);
```

### Expected Result States

The check interacts with the Spatie Health dashboard and JSON endpoints using these states:

- **Ok:** All database migrations have been successfully applied.
- **Failed:** One or more database migrations are pending.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```shell
composer test
```
